# Sound Assets

These files power the in-game sound effects. Replace them with your own clips if desired.

- `click.mp3` – button presses / interactions
- `win.mp3` – victory celebration
- `lose.mp3` – defeat cue
- `tick.wav` – final 5‑second warning chime for the round timer

Keep the filenames the same so the `use-sound` hooks in `RoomClient.tsx` can locate them.
